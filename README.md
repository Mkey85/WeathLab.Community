# WeathLab.Community

WealthLab.Community is an open source library of custom technical indicators, extension methods, demo strategies and other useful additions to Wealth-Lab 7 created by the Wealth-Lab user community.

We'll accept custom indicators that require logical operations to populate the TimeSeries or those that involve a minimum of 4 simple math operations. The most simple methods should be reserved for programming "on the fly" so as not to over populate the library with short snippets of generally non-useful code.
